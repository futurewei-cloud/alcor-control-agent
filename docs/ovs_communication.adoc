== Communication between ACA and OVS

TBD:

                    +--------------------+
                    |  Alcor Control     |
                    |     Agent          |
                    +--------------------+
                    |  ovs-vsctl and     |
                    |   ovs-ofctl only?  |
                    +--------------------+
         +--------------------------------------------------+
                    +--------------------+
                    |  OVS-db?           |
                    +--------------------+

== Highlevel Architecture, Why is it so special?

TBD - Eric/XiaoDong


== OVS Implementation

TBD - what is OVS, why are we using it, what is the nice thing about OVS?


== Workflow with Alcor for port programming

TBD - Eric


== Programming OVS

TBD - XiaoDong

How do we call into OVS, what is the exact command we use to program a new port? What is the port configuration info needed?


== OVS-db entries on Local Host

TBD - will this be interesting?


== Alcor Network State Update

TBD - do we need to modify the current network state message? 


== Dataplane Programming Interface

TBD - Eric 


== OVS Implementation

TBD - XiaoDong

. when and who will initialize OVS? What is the initialization steps
. when and who will create the main br-int bridge?
. what happen when there are multiple physical NICs on the system, which NIC do we pick to hook up br-int?
. Do we create the br-tun bridge when we see it is vxlan/gre? we decided to default to vxlan if it is not specified
.. what is the exact command to connect the new port to the new br-tun?
.. what is the exact command to program the new br-tun to do encap and decap
. what happen if host crashed, do we save the OVS config locally and restore it? Or we ask the Alcor controller for the whole set of cofiguration upon restart


== Compare to Neutron Implementation

TBD. How is the perf, latency and availablity etc compare to Neutron?
