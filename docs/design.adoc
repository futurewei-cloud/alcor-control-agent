= Cloud Fabric Network Agent

== Summary

The Cloud Fabric Network Control Agent runs on each host machine. It serves as a simple stateless proxy between network controller and host machine networking components for control plane operations.

== Requirements

. Network Control Agent will reside on each host machine to interface between network controller and host networking components. The main responsible is the create and configure network to 
enable connectivity (VPC IP < - > Physical IP mapping) between VMs/Containers within the datacenter and the outside world through EIP.

. It will update networking configuration on the host:
	.. Setup networking/linux bridge/OVS on the host (if not exist)
	.. Create vNIC and vPort for VM (unless this is done by Compute agent)
	.. Configure vNIC and vPort, connect to the VM
	.. Attach Security group to a vNIC TODO: add more detail
	.. Attached transit switch/router to the corresponding vNIC(veth)
	
. It will also update VPC Configuration (VPC, Subnet, Security Group, Routing) including CRUD (create/Read/Update/Delete) VPC/Subnet/Endpoint.

. Interface with SN agent for passing network monitoring data (for https://github.com/futurewei-cloud/Transit/blob/master/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/design/monitoring.adoc[Network Monitoring] option B only)

== Roles

The network agent will have the follow roles, the code below will live in one binary. 

. Local Host Networking Agent
. Transit switch/router user mode Agent
. Network Component upgrade Agent

== Communication between Network Control Agent and Transit Agent

                    |     Agent          |
                    +--------------------+
                    |  Transit Daemon    |
                    +------------------ -+   User Mode
         +--------------------------------------------------+
                    +--------------------+   Kernel Mode
                    |  Transit Agent     |      
                    |     xdp program    |
                    +--------------------+

== Workflow

. Customer Creates a new VPC
	.. Allocate transit router
		... Smart place [router1, router2]
		... Go to router1, router2 and add VPC to the VPC table (Call “Update VPC”) (VPC table)
. Customer creates new network(subnet)
	.. Allocate transit switch
		... Smart place [Switch1, Switch2]
		... Go to router1, and router2 and “Update net” (net table)
		... Go to s1, s2, s3 and call “Update net" (net table)
		... Go to s1, s2, s3 and call “Update VPC” (VPC table)
. Customer create a VM with endpoint 1 at net0
	.. Allocate endpoint
		... Go to VM Host create endpoint and update the transit switch info in endpoint table
		... Go to all switches (s1,s2,s3) update endpoint

== Interface with Network Controller
Working in progress...

. API
https://github.com/openstack/neutron/blob/master/neutron/agent/securitygroups_rpc.py

. Protocol 

. Authentication 
Huawei Cloud allow either using tokens (valid for 24 hours) or AK/SK when calling ECS APIs. +
https://support-intl.huaweicloud.com/en-us/api-ecs/en-us_topic_0124306062.html +
Openstack only talks about using authentication token: +
https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/config-reference/common-configurations/auth.html


== Interaction with Monitoring system (SN)

Since Network Control Agent is a simple stateless proxy, SN monitoring agent will pull metrics data based on the type of networking data it needs, on the frequency required for its analytical system (for the 9/30 delivery).  https://github.com/futurewei-cloud/Transit/blob/master/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/design/monitoring.adoc[See here for more detail.]


== API Versioning of Network Control Agent and Network Controller

==== Motivation
When upgrading our codebase, we want to version our components in such a way so that old clients have time to upgrade/adopt, and new clients can use the new features without issues. +
There are multiple strategies that can be used to allow this, and their use cases are project dependent. +

==== Strategy
The current planned strategy is to have clients explicitly state the API version in a config XML/JSON/yaml file. The Network Control Agent will then consume, and execute the correct calls accordingly. +
Further implementation options are compared below ^[2],[3],[4]^

[width="100%",options="header"]
|====================
| Strategy | Pros | Cons 
| Make API self-aware of versions | Maintain only one codebase | Difficult to remove deprecated resources and endpoints 
|   | Deploy just one API codebase  |
| Maintain multiple branches for major API versions | Easy to delete old API versions | Convoluted branch structure deployment pipeline     
|====================

== API Design

. Heart beat with the controller

. CRUD (create/Read/Update/Delete) VPC/Subnet/Endpoint  

. CRUD of Network Security Group and attachment to the Subnet/Endpoint

. Get metrics call from SN (for https://github.com/futurewei-cloud/Transit/blob/master/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/design/monitoring.adoc[Network Monitoring] option B only)
