== Workflow of Network Configuration Programming

=== Router Programming

Scenario A:
Routing workflow between different EPs in the same subnet on different hosts

1. The packet from virtual machine 1 on the left reaches the br-int via the Linux bridge and is tagged with VLAN ID Tag
2. Reach br-tun, convert VLAN ID to Tunnel ID, send from VxLAN Tunnel, and reach another compute node
3. Go through the reverse process on another compute node to reach the virtual machine on the right

================================
Scenario B:
Routing workflow for accessing internet
1. Packet leaves the virtual machine, passes the Linux bridge, arrives at br-int, and is tagged with VLAN ID
2. Reach br-tun, convert VLAN ID to Tunnel ID
3. Enter the VxLAN channel from the physical network card
4. Network card from the VxLAN channel to the Neutron node
5. Reach the br-tun connected to the physical network card and convert the Tunnel ID to VLAN ID
6. Reach br-int, then router, router's NAT table will convert fixed IP address to floatiing IP address, and then route to br-ex
7. Go out from the physical network card connected to br-ex to the external network
================================
Scenario C:

Accessing an EP from an external network IP is the opposite process.
